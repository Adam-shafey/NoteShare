# NoteShare

The system allows end users (students, teaching assistants and teachers) to share documents. The documents will consist of primarily notes or additional explanation of course material. The system creates a greater sense of community and increased interaction outside of the classroom setting. Not only will students be able to retrieve notes they missed but they can engage with the other users by asking questions. Overall, the system will provide a convenient way for information to be shared and discussed during a school semester.
